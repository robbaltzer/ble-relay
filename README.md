# ble-relay

A simple POC app that runs on two Apple devices. A count is passed back and forth between the two devices, incrementing the count on each transfer. This uses BLE support in CoreBluetooth. Will show how Apple devices can be controllers and peripherals simultaneously.

It also uses SwiftUI for its rudimentary UI.
